In the Web Developer field, I aspire to be either a self-sufficient front-end or full-stack developer. I don't mind where I work, as long as there is opportunity to learn and grow. I plan to build of my current traits and skills in this program by keeping notes, and going back to the basics to stay sharp. 
     My favorite assignment had to do with CSS grid, because it opened my eyes about how web pages can be layed out, and gave me a new perspective between the relationship of HTML and CSS. My biggest accomplishment in this course would be understanding how HTML and CSS can be used together to create awesome looking static web pages. As a result of this course, I have learned to take things one step at a time and make sure I've understood the basics before moving on. The information I've learned are the building blocks I'll need to achieve that first job as an entry level Web Developer.
